                            Before starting this project, I had an idea to save
                            all the funny things that my friends said in Discord
                            to a website that is viewable and fun to look at. I 
                            had experience with Mongo and Node.js but was only somewhat
                            exposed to Express and React during a few hackathons. This 
                            project got me to learn both of those frameworks from 0 and 
                            I learned a lot along the way. I stumbled across many challenges
                            trying to make the website but in the end I got it working and
                            like the result. I want to eventually come back to the project
                            and work on the design of the website and try to migrate the backend
                            from Heroku to another service because Heroku loads my data in slowly.

                            My idea for this project came to me when I was playing the game Rainbow
                            Six Siege. I wanted something that could pull player statistics so that
                            me and my friends could see other players' ranks and such.
                            This was my first big project after learning the basics of Javascript.
                            All I knew how to do was a very simple GET/POST request and I dove into the
                            deep end trying to figure this project out. It took me weeks of googling to
                            really get some results, but in the end it made me a way better developer
                            than I previously was. I attribute this project to my love of Javascript and
                            success in hackathons/other projects.
